    * create package

    * change .C to .Call

2014-7-1 Krisztian Sebestyen
    * fixed the weighted hamming and ibs kernel code both in R and C (typo in the paper) 
    * separate .Call from native C code in kernels.c/h and matrix.c/h so that C code may be included in other packages without having to include
    Rinternals.h library (i.e. SEXP stuff)
      - created files Call_kernels.c and Call_matrix.c
      - renamed all C functions called via .Call to 'Call_funcname'
    * updated runit.kernel.R since ibs() has changed
    * added rrbind(),rcbind(),upper.trap(),lower.trap() to matrix2.R
    * with .Call I can pass a NULL pointer to C hence I can use more natural 'NULL' logic in C in many functions

2018.07.01
    * Add %.% and deprecate %+% because %+% is also defined in ggplot2 for
    adding a comment to plot
    * Replace %+% by %.% throughout 

2018.10.17
    * Modify get.sim.res to handle the case when the file contains a single
    value
    * Fix a bug in mytex that happens when saving to the current directory
    * Make getFormattedSummary more flexible by allowing different paramemters
    to be printed with different number of significant digits
    * Update mypairs to generate a ladder plot

2019.01.18
    * Fix an error in fixedef.lm

2019.08.02  
    * Print dir if get.sim.res throws an error due to empty dir

2019.10.14
    * Fix a bug in mytex that occurs when writing a list of tables and the row names have duplicates

2019.11.13
    * add paired option to myboxplot.list to allow paired Wilcox test
