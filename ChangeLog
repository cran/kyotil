	* create package

2014-4-1 Youyi Fong
	* change .C to .Call

2014-7-1 Krisztian Sebestyen
    * fixed the weighted hamming and ibs kernel code both in R and C (typo in the paper) 
	* separate .Call from native C code in kernels.c/h and matrix.c/h so that C code may be included in other packages without having to include
	Rinternals.h library (i.e. SEXP stuff)
	  - created files Call_kernels.c and Call_matrix.c
	  - renamed all C functions called via .Call to 'Call_funcname'
	* updated runit.kernel.R since ibs() has changed
	* added rrbind(),rcbind(),upper.trap(),lower.trap() to matrix2.R
	* with .Call I can pass a NULL pointer to C hence I can use more natural 'NULL' logic in C in many functions

	* Add %.% and deprecate %+% because %+% is also defined in ggplot2 for
	adding a comment to plot

2018.07.01
	* Replace %+% by %.% throughout
